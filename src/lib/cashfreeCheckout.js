// Fallback path for when api/payments/create-qr.js couldn't get an embedded
// UPI QR from Cashfree (their "Order Pay" API needs separate approval on
// some accounts -- see the comment in create-qr.js) but DID create the
// order, so it returned a `paymentSessionId` instead. This loads Cashfree's
// hosted-checkout SDK and opens their own payment page for that session --
// no special approval needed for this path, and their page offers UPI QR,
// UPI intent, cards, netbanking, etc. on its own.
//
// Used by QrPaymentPanel.jsx and DealerPortal.jsx's TopUpModal whenever
// qrImageUrl comes back null from create-qr.js.
